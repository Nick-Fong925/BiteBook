# BiteBook 
The pandemic highlighted the challenges of restaurants as hundreds of small businesses were forced to close their doors permanently. The lockdown measures and restrictions on indoor dining severely impacted their ability to operate and generate revenue. While many of those issues have slowly gotten more manageable, a digital shift happened within the industry in which online ordering and delivery became crucial for survival. However, many small restaurants lacked the infrastructure and expertise to quickly adapt to this digital transformation. Establishing efficient online ordering systems and partnerships with delivery platforms proved challenging for some. Other than having online ordering services, marketing became increasingly important for businesses to prioritize as gaining a consistent clientele and gaining new consumers have always led to further growth or a stable income.

BiteBook seeks to help businesses that struggle with marketing by providing a platform for foodies, families, and friends to share restaurants and build a community around local eateries. The inspiration for BiteBook is the oldest form of marketing -word of mouth, instead of those restaurant names or pictures being lost in the family group chat, find them all in one place, BiteBook!
